    <description>
    Spotube is a Flutter based lightweight spotify client. It utilizes the power 
    of Spotify  &amp; Youtube's public API  &amp; creates a hazardless, performant  &amp; resource
    friendly User Experience

    # Features
    - Open source/libre software
    - Anonymous/guest login
    - Cross platform support
    - No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
    - Lightweight &amp; resource-friendly
    - Native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
    - Playback control is done locally instead of on the server
    - Small size &amp; less data usage
    - No Spotify or YouTube ads since it uses all public &amp; free APIs (It is still recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists' YouTube channels or liking their tracks on Spotify. Purchasing Spotify Premium is usually the best way to support their valuable creations.)
    - Time synced lyrics
    - Downloadable tracks
